# Machine Learning Models for Data Science

This repository consists of Machine Learning Models built using Octave and Python to help build intuition around several Machine Learning algorithms.
It includes hands-on assignments I completed while taking the Machine Learning by Stanford course on Coursera and the Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science course on Udemy.

This repository looks at machine learning models such as:
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Neural Networks
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Principal Component Analysis
  - And many more
